# MicroPython for LilyGO TTGO T-Watch-2020
************************************************************************
## Description:
This is a fork of the official version of the micropython. \
This micropython fork is SPECIALLY sharpened and designed for LilyGO TTGO T-Watch-2020-V1 watches.  \
Other TTGO watch models are not supported!
************************************************************************
## Integrated libraries:
1. `bma423` - Low-g driver acceleration sensor. \
   Written in C by [lewisxhe](https://github.com/lewisxhe). \
   Was taken from [here](https://github.com/lewisxhe/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo)

2. `pcf8563` - Real-time clock/calendar driver. \
   Written in Python by [lewisxhe](https://github.com/lewisxhe).  \
   Was taken from [here](https://github.com/lewisxhe/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo)

3. `lvgl` - Popular embedded graphics library. \
   Written in C.

4. `ft6x36` - Touch screen driver. \
   Written in C.  \
   Was taken from [here](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32).

5. `AXP202` - Advanced multi-channel power management chip driver. \
   Written in Python.  \
   Updated to latest version by Anodev.  \
   Was taken from [here](https://github.com/lewisxhe/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo).

6. `st7789_lvgl` - Display driver. \
   Written in C. \
   Was taken from [here](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32).
7. `ttgo` - Port of the official [library](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library) for LilyGo TTGO watches.
   Written in Python by Anodev.

Examples of using these libraries are located in the `examples/ttgo/` folder \
For api look `ports/esp32/boards/LILYGO_T_WATCH_2020_V1` folder

## Build Instructions
### WARNING:
Please set `ESPIDF` parameter for the esp-idf install dir. \
It needs to match Micropython expected esp-idf, otherwise a warning will be displayed (and build will probably fail) \
For more details refer to [Setting up the toolchain and ESP-IDF](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md#setting-up-the-toolchain-and-esp-idf) \
For more details please refer to [Micropython ESP32 README](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md).
### Commands:
1. Install all important libraries via `sudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev libffi-dev git pkg-config libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev python`
2. Clone this repo via `git clone https://github.com/OPHoperHPO/lilygo-ttgo-twatch-2020-micropython`
3. Clone all submodules via `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. Configure esp-idf and toolbox
5. Edit paths to esp-idf and toolchain in `makefile` in `ports/esp32`
6. Build mpy-cross via `make -C mpy-cross`
7. Build micropython and flash it via `make -C ports/esp32 deploy`
